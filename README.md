# Smart Miner Helmet

A comprehensive safety helmet designed for miners, integrating advanced features to enhance personal safety and streamline emergency management in mining environments.

## Features

- **Fall Detection:** Instantly detects dangerous falls and triggers an alert, improving rescue response times.
- **Smoke Detector:** Monitors air quality and detects the presence of smoke, warning miners of potential fire or hazardous gas leaks.
- **Emergency Beacon:** Sends distress signals with real-time location to supervisors or rescue teams in case of emergencies.
- **Attendance Recording:** Automatically logs when miners enter and exit the worksite for efficient attendance tracking and safety compliance.
- **Additional Sensors (Optional):** Easily expandable for temperature, humidity, or other environmental monitoring.

## System Components

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino, ESP32, or similar for sensor integration and logic control.
- **Sensors:** Accelerometer (fall detection), smoke/gas sensor, GPS module, RFID/NFC for attendance.
- **Communication Module:** LoRa, Wi-Fi, or GSM for remote alerts and attendance syncing.
- **Power Supply:** Rechargeable battery with battery management for field use.
- **Alert System:** Buzzer, LED, and wireless notification to control room/central server.

## How It Works

1. **Real-Time Monitoring:** Helmet continuously monitors miner’s movements, air quality, and location.
2. **Automatic Alerts:** On detecting a fall or smoke, helmet triggers alarms (audible/visual) and sends wireless notifications.
3. **Emergency Beacon:** Pressing the emergency button transmits a distress signal with location data.
4. **Attendance Logging:** Miners scan their RFID/NFC badge; the system timestamps entry/exit and syncs with the attendance database.

## Setup & Usage

1. **Assembly:** Mount sensors and modules securely inside the helmet shell.
2. **Configuration:** 
   - Upload firmware to the microcontroller.
   - Configure wireless network settings for beacon and attendance data.
   - Register miner badges in the attendance system.
3. **Operation:** 
   - Power on the helmet before entering the mine.
   - Ensure all system checks (battery, sensor status) pass.
   - Use as regular safety helmet—system runs automatically.

```

## Data Flow

- **Sensor Data:** Collected and processed on-board.
- **Events (Fall/Smoke/Emergency):** Trigger alarms and send wireless packets to a central monitoring station.
- **Attendance:** Logged locally and synced to server via network module.

## Applications

- Underground mining
- Construction sites
- Tunnels and hazardous industrial environments

## Future Improvements

- Integration with mine management software
- Real-time health monitoring (heart rate, temperature)
- Voice communication system
- Solar-powered charging
